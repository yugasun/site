### About Serverless

We’re a fully-remote team of developers, spread all over the world, focused on building world-class developer tooling for the future of event-driven serverless infrastructure. In June 2015 we began building the world’s first serverless application framework, enabling developers to build web, mobile and IoT applications exclusively on event-driven infrastructure like AWS Lambda. Since then, we’ve been on the front page of Hacker News several times, collected over 9,000 Github stars and received funding from two of the top VC firms in the cloud infrastructure space (we’ll announce who soon).

### Why you will love working with us

#### Ambition

We have a huge goal: to empower developers to build the next great software products and companies by allowing them to focus more time on building product and less on operations, scaling and infrastructure management. If you enjoy disrupting large industries and working on big hairy problems, you’ll love it here.

#### Productivity

We place the same focus on productivity with our team members that we do with our customers. That means great tooling, light-weight processes, and the removal of distractions so that you have the freedom to get stuff done.

#### Personal Happiness

We believe that happy people are productive people and we make it a goal to give you enough time and space to develop your personal life along with your professional life. That means unlimited paid vacation with a required minimum of 20 days off per year.

#### Transparency

We want everyone to have a clear understanding of the state of the company and to contribute to different parts of the organization. That means opening up as much information as possible including finances, salaries, and metrics.
